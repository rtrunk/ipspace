# Exercise 2

## Infrastructure as code setup

This exercise establishes a connection to Azure, and verifies that Terraform can create resources.  The IPSpace Terraform example files were  modified to create resources in the East US zone with different private IP addresses.  

Note that only the network components were created -- I did not create any virtual machines in this exercise.

The file *Exercise 2 session log.txt* contains a complete transcript of the session.
